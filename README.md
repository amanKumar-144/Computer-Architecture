# Computer-Architecture


In this project, I have build a MIPS compiler which takes instruction from the user and converts it into binary format.It also looks for instructions which are independent or dependent and displays them to the user.For checking the MIPS compiler,I have taken programs like finding factorial of a number and then convert that code into binary format as recognised by MIPS architecture.
